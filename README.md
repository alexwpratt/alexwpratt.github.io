## Inconsequentialism Podcast

I started a podcast while I was wrapping up my degree as a fun little project! I love podcasting as a medium (some of my favs are made at [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com)), and I wanted to get my feet wet and see what I could do on my own. I was the host, producer, engineer, and everything in between. Big thanks to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) for having an easy to use platform to upload it for free, [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) for being my audio editting software, my wife's grandpa [Speedy Beer's](https://speedybeers.com) old band ["Speedy and the Reverbs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNlXR4Tdf6M) for the music, and to my guests! It was a blast to make. Maybe I'll pick this specific podcast back up someday, but don't hold your breath haha.
