I really like basketball. Like a lot.

I love the game, the strategy, the competition, the talent, the personalities, and the joy around it. I love playing it (albeit poorly), I love watching it, and I love talking about it. Among other things, basketball has a lot of lessons and metaphors for life embedded into it.

Check out this clip from a game the other night between the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcqDydmVa-s).`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcqDydmVa-s`

In a close game with time running out, Buddy Hield hits a bold, contested, and very long three. He's the best shooter on the team, and one of the best in the NBA this year. A deadball occurs right after, and you see an exchange between him and his coach, Dave Joerger. I don't what the actual words said here are, but Buddy Hield's reaction seems to say Joerger was pretty unhappy about that shot he took.

Let's be clear here: in the game of basketball, bad shots go in sometimes. That can trick you into thinking that those bad shots were actually good shots. Maybe the shot Buddy Hield took was really bad. Maybe if he practices all the time and knows he can hit consistently, that makes it a good shot. But regardless of whether it was a "good" or "bad" shot, a skilled, confident, and oft-successful shooter took a shot that went in and brought the game against the reigning champions within reach.

What happens next is crazy and honestly, a bummer. After a heated interaction on the sideline with his coach, clearly Buddy Hield was frustrated, and his confidence in himself probably wavered. Fast forward, and the Kings have the ball, down two points and the game within reach. He gets the ball in the exact same spot as before, with even less defense than before. And what happens? He hesitates. Drives into the defense and takes a contested shot, game over.

With the full confidence of what he had done a few moments earlier, he probably takes and hits the shot, and the Kings get a big win in their run to make the playoffs.

What are you supposed to do as a coach in this scenario? If you really think it's a bad shot, how do communicate that? When is the right time, during the game? After the game? In a film session the next day?

I'm not trying to say anything about Dave Joerger as a coach. I've never sat in one of his practices. I don't even really know what he said here in this moment. I'm sure there are much "better" coaches who would have screwed this up, and much "worse" ones who would have done better here. But ignoring all of that, I do think this is a metaphor for one aspect of what a leader should do: inspire confidence.

Steve Kerr, who interestingly enough is the opposing coach in the game from above, has had plenty of experience watching his players in "heat check" moments. Check out this clip from a game from a few years ago: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudiJUlxb10)`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudiJUlxb10`

What Steph Curry does here is ridiculous. But without getting into the basketball weeds, let's see how Steve Kerr, the coach that's supposed to keep these talented guys playing as a team and headed in the right direction.

Steve Kerr is seen as a unique coach by many people in the league, and he's been incredibly successful thus far. Take a look at the last scene here as he's watching the play. When Steph does his thing here, we see his reactions here in real time. "What on earth are you doing?" "Why did you think that was a good idea?" "How did that go in?" "What am I even doing here?" "Do we like talk about this play later about how that was probably not a good idea, or am I just supposed to pretend it didn't happen, or am I supposed to praise you and risk you going even crazier next time?"

Steve Kerr probably wasn't too happy about that shot being taken. But hey, it went in. A skilled, confident, and oft-successful shooter in Steph Curry took a difficult shot and made it. Bad shot or good shot, it went in and the crowd loved it. Steph Curry takes a lot of these kinds of shots. Some don't go in, but a lot do. And every one that does is what makes him one of the best shooters the game has ever seen. What happens if after every one of these shots, make or miss, Steve Kerr pulls him aside and yells at him? Or gives him the side-eye? Or benches him? Or doesn't resign him to another contract? Steph Curry has learned for him what is a good shot and what is a bad shot by being set free in these moments, inspired by the confidence his fans, his team, and most importantly his coach have given him.

Whatever your leadership style is, whatever kind of team you are building, and whatever role you play, inspire confidence. Most people are trying to do well and want to succeed. Chose to be someone who builds up and inspires confidence in the members of their team, and watch them grow.
